# Mega_dSMF
Analysing nanopore sequencing of dSMF data with Megalodon

- To demultiplex your raw reads with DeepBinner, you have to have used these sequencing/barcoding kit: EXP-NBD103, EXP-NBD104 or very similar.

- Upon launching setup.sh, you will be asked to input Guppy's latest version.

- GCG, HCG, GCH motifs will be explored for 5mC (H is any base except G). Refer to varSettings.sh if you wish to modify this.
